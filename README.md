# NuMSForge
NuMSForge streamlines nucleic acid mass spectrometry. It calculates m/z values from RNA/DNA sequences, predicts sequences from m/z, simulates RNase digestion, and offers mass data for nucleotides, including modifications. With monoisotopic/average mass modes and customizable settings, itâ€™s a powerful tool for RNA research and MS data analysis.
